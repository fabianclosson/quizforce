# Task ID: 4
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the database schema in Supabase based on the requirements specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create the following tables in Supabase: users, categories, certifications, packages, package_certifications, areas, practice_exams, questions, answers, enrollments, exam_attempts, user_answers, reviews, coupon_codes, and payments. Set up appropriate relationships between tables using foreign keys. Configure RLS (Row Level Security) policies for each table to ensure proper data access control. Create necessary indexes for performance optimization. Set up triggers for automatic timestamp updates. Create database views for commonly used queries.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all tables are created with the correct schema. Test relationships between tables. Ensure RLS policies work correctly. Test database performance with sample data. Verify that indexes are properly set up.
