# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the authentication system with email/password and Google OAuth support using Supabase Auth.
# Details:
Create authentication API routes for signup, login, logout, and password reset. Implement the signup form with email verification. Build the login form with email/password and Google OAuth options. Create password reset functionality. Set up authentication hooks and context for React components. Implement protected routes using middleware. Create user session management. Handle authentication errors and display appropriate messages.

Test signup flow with email verification. Verify login with both email/password and Google OAuth. Test password reset functionality. Ensure protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Test session persistence across page refreshes.
